## Implementation Tips

- Start with the core systems first (state management, ECS, game loop)
- Use TypeScript for better type safety in complex systems
- Implement systems in isolation with clear interfaces
- Test each system independently before integration
- Use dependency injection for system communication
- Implement proper error handling from the beginning
- Create utility functions for common operations
- Document each system's purpose and API

## Development Approach

1. **Iterative Development**
   - Build minimal viable version of each system
   - Test thoroughly
   - Refactor and improve
   - Add features incrementally

2. **Code Organization**
   - Keep related files together
   - Use clear naming conventions
   - Document public APIs
   - Create utility libraries for common tasks

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Profile early and often
   - Optimize hot paths
   - Use appropriate data structures
   - Consider memory usage patterns

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit test individual systems
   - Integration tests for system interactions
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Regression testing setup

## Recommended Tools

- **Version Control**: Git with proper branching strategy
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing on each commit
- **Project Management**: Use issue tracker with priorities
- **Documentation**: Keep design documents updated
- **Communication**: Regular team sync-ups

## Risk Management

- **Technical Risks**: 
  - Over-engineering early systems
  - Performance bottlenecks in core systems
  - Integration issues between complex systems

- **Mitigation Strategies**
  - Prototype complex features first
  - Code reviews for critical components
  - Automated testing coverage
  - Performance monitoring from day one

This guide should be reviewed and updated as the project evolves. Priorities may shift as requirements change or new opportunities emerge.
